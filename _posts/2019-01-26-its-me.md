Hello. I’m Emily. I’ve been blogging since LiveJournal days, usually under a pseudonym, because in the 90s the internet was a doomsday device for perverts, creeps and weirdos. **Waves**

I started with art and found myself deeply involved in tech. This site is a reflection of my journey through the digital landscape, blending my interests in computer science, philosophy, and psychology.

Here’s what you’ll find:

About Me: A bit about my background and interests.
Portfolio: A showcase of projects I’ve worked on.
Blog: Some other bits.
If you’d like to work with me, you can email me at emmillennial@gmail.com
