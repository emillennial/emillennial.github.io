Hello. I’m Emily. I’ve been blogging since LiveJournal days, usually under a pseudonym, because in the 90s the internet was a doomsday device for perverts, creeps and weirdos. **Waves**

It started as an allotment blog, but it took a turn when the local council just couldn’t relax for a goddamn minute. So, it’s less about that now. I continue to grow things from my flat, but it’s more about adventures into mature student hood, as well as things I love, and things I hate. It’s likely going to slip into things I’ve watched, played, eaten, heard, until it’s just a screaming match in an echo chamber.

Most photos are mine.. Unless they’re not, then I’ll tag and link them as accurately as I can.
