Hello. I’ve been blogging since LiveJournal days, usually under a pseudonym, because in the 90s the internet was a doomsday device for perverts, creeps and weirdos. Waves  

This “blog” started as an allotment blog, but it took a turn when the local council just couldn’t relax for a goddamn minute. So, it’s less about that now. I continue to grow things from my flat, but it’s more about adventures into mature studenthood, as well as things I love, and things I hate. It’s likely going to slip into things I’ve watched, played, eaten, heard until it’s just a screaming match in an echo chamber.

The degree I’m undertaking is a BSc in Computing, ideally, moving on to Computer Science, Software, Networking or Game Development. Who can say? I definitely can’t. 

I like story and character-driven games with consequence, thought and narrative (beautiful design and sound are equally important tbh). You may read that as: alien sex and being an elf.  And you’d not be much off the mark.

I already have a BA(Hons) in illustration, which I squandered in my 20s doing crappy meaningless jobs for money. I live in England, in the south west, where I now work full time in STEM outreach. I’m usually always tired and tend to overuse emojis. 💀🤙🌚🌊🍕
