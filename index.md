# Welcome to My Digital World

I started with art and found myself deeply involved in tech. This site is a reflection of my journey through the digital landscape, blending my interests in computer science, philosophy, and psychology.

Here’s what you’ll find:

- **[About Me](aboutme)**: A bit about my background and interests.
- **[Portfolio](portfolio)**: A showcase of projects I've worked on.
- **[[Blog](/blog/)**: Some other bits.

If you'd like to work with me, you can email me at emmillennial@gmail.com
