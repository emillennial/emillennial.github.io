# Welcome to My Digital World

I started with art and found myself deeply involved in tech. This site is a reflection of my journey through the digital landscape, blending my interests in computer science, philosophy, and psychology.

Here’s what you’ll find:

- **[About Me](aboutme)**: A bit about my background and interests.
- **[Portfolio](portfolio)**: A showcase of projects I've worked on.
- **[Links](links)**: Some of my favourite resources and connections.

Dive in and explore!
