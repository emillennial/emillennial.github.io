Started with art, ended up in tech. Now, I spend my days immersed in the peculiar world of digital anthropology. I’m currently studying computer science, philosophy, and psychology at the Open University—working towards passing, eventually. After that, maybe a master’s, perhaps even a PhD, if I can avoid existential dread long enough.

I’m interested in the ways people interact with technology, the digital landscape, and how it shapes us. The big questions, really. Not that anyone has the answers, but it’s entertaining to watch us all pretend.

In my spare time, I enjoy the company of bleak literature—Lapvona, The Bell Jar, The Master and Margarita, Vonnegut. Naturally, all that darkness, I'm going to be a little bit into folklore, as well as music that makes you somehow feel everything and nothing simultaneously.
